						question : "How do I ensure that competitors aren't contacting the same companies as me and use the same data from the survey?",
						answer : "The NBI offers partners the possibility of using and sharing the platform with whomever they wish to. Your contacts get access to the platform via a unique url e.g. magnetix.networkedbusiness.org. We do not control how or to whom you share this. Partners share their unique url via media outlets like newsletters, ads, social media, etc. "+
"If two or more partners invite the same contact it is up to the contact to choose which invitation he/she wishes to accept. When a company signs up via your launch site, only you get the contact info of the company. And the company is the only one that can see their non-anonymized data. You can request access to the data of one of your contacts and the company can choose to grant or deny access to data. ",
					},{
						question : "How can companies benchmark themselves against other companies/industries if theyâ€™re alone in that industry/market?",
						answer : "When companies take the survey and get access to the dashboard, there are two advantages:\n"+
								 "1.) They are presented with and forced to reflect upon a structured framework i.e. a map, of how companies can utilize the five technologies, across six business functions. Companies can reflect on the topics they need to consider further when they work with them strategically."+ 
								  "This process is a learning experience. Companies get to see new potential and gain new insights. The structured analysis of the company is a great outset for creating new strategies and projects.\n"+
								  "2.)Companies are able to benchmark themselves against a chosen benchmark and see how they stack up against competitors. Users can define their benchmark across three dimensions: Country, Industry and Company Size (measured in number of employees)."+ 
									"Users can always see how many people are represented in the benchmark and assess how big a say the numbers have. The benchmark feature will increase in value as more and more users come aboard.",
